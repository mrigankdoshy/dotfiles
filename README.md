## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

**Warning:** This repo is mainly for me, but if you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don‚Äôt want or need. Don‚Äôt blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

- Download the `.install.sh` script and run
```sh
chmod +x ./.install.sh && ./.install.sh
```

## üöß Updates

This repository will be updated from time to time to tailor my needs, and as I get time to make improvements to the install process (such as updating the default macOS settings)
